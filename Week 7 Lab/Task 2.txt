3 Bad Looking Websites:

    jamilin.com
        --> They should've made the site a bit easier  to read.
        --> They should've made the site a bit less cramped.

    gatesnfences.com
        --> They should've picked a better contrasting colour for the background (gray + black on pink is kind of ugly).
        --> They could've used a bit of variation of fonts.

    arngren.net
        --> There's just too much going on at the same time.
        --> They could've at least sectioned off their items...



3 Good Looking Websites:

    Google.ca
        --> Very easy on the eyes.
        --> Very user-friendly and easy to navigate.

    YouTube.ca
        --> Refined interface.
        --> Simple to understand.

    w3schools.com
        --> Very helpful and easy to navigate.
        --> Information is well-detailed and easy to follow.
